One of Movable Type's most important features is its template module
caching system, which can ameliorate most publishing performance issues.
However if you are a developer or designer and utilize this feature 
heavily, then troubleshooting issues that arise from it can be difficult
because Movable Type is so opaque. 

This plugin helps developing sites using template module caching easier
by providing users with these features:

* view the cache stored for a given template module
* clear the cache for a list of modules
